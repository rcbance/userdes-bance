						<p>My name is Randreb Bance but you can call me Thirdy, I'm originally from Cavite City it is near Kawit Cavite where Emilio Aguinaldo is from, but my family transferred to Villamor Airbase Pasay City. We transferred because of my father, he is a Military Officer and he was assigned to Villamor, so our family had to go with him. </p>
						<p>My experience here in APC has been awesome even though I'm not good at expressing my feelings, I think it's because of my friends who welcomed and made me feel home since day one. I'm still trying to cope with the fact that I must be more independent now that I'm already in college. </p>
						<p>My dog who is named sky is also one of the reasons why college life is sort of getting easy because he would always make me happy whenever I feel so sad or stressed, and I don’t know there is something about that dog that really makes me calm and happy. My experience from my freshmen year here in APC taught me a lot of things like, time management is really important, you have to do your best at every task that was given to you, and most especially take care of yourself. Sometimes we are focusing too much on school stuffs that we forget about our real life and for me it is much more important. I chose I.T because ever since I was young always dream about being a computer programmer and it is because of my cousin who showed me how amazing being a programmer is.  </p>
						<p>Right now, I still want to be a programmer but I’m having a hard time studying it and understanding different type of languages. I’ve played a lot of sports when I was young, I started with Taekwondo next is Swimming and I even played Badminton, but when I discovered Basketball, I was really into it and it become favorite sport. I was addicted to it because I love the way that you have to work hard everyday just to become the best or good at it and I also love the competition. </p>
						<p>I worked hard and I become a member of our High School varsity team, the San Sebastian College Recoletos De Cavite Baycats. I won one MVP award in a summer league and it was really unforgettable because is it my first and last MVP award for my varsity team. When I started my college life, I lost my desire to play because it’s useless now and I’m very busy with schoolworks. Overall, I’m a very hardworking person when I want something, I always do my best to get it or achieved it. I love my friends and my dog they’re the reason why I’m surviving college, and I want all of us to succeed by graduating on time. I want to be rich and become a CEO of my own company, so I’ll have the capability of helping people in need. And I hope someday I’ll be able to create a program or an App that could help change the world, because I do believe that the reason why we are here on earth is to have a purpose and to make this world even better not just for ourselves but for everyone around us.  </p>

						<p>Introducing my favorite App, and it is Messenger. Messenger is a free mobile messaging app that has a lot of features, have you ever had this problem where you don’t know how to contact your friends or family member because you don’t have their number, or your load balances isn’t enough? Well, problem solve because Messenger is here. This is my favorite app because It is easy to search my relatives or friends and communicate with them FOR FREE. </p>
						<p>. I already told you that I’m a shy person and messenger is really helpful for people like me because I can chat someone without worrying that he/she would can bored or find me weird.  </p>
						<p>In conclusion, this app is very useful and easy to use, even my grandparents are using it to communicate us. And it is available in different platforms like Android and IOS so everyone can use it. Messenger doesn’t take so much data for you to use it that is why I like it more than text messages. And you call also use your free data to use messenger, so you don’t really have to worrying about Wi-Fi connection or anything. </p>
						<p>. There are only bad effects in using messenger, first is that anyone can use it, they can use the App to take advantage of other people like create a fake account to get private information or they will use it to bully someone. The best way to avoid this kind people is that, you have to make sure that the person you are talking to is real and try not to talk to strangers at all. You can also limit your friends to avoid these incidents.   </p>

					</h2>
					<div class="open">
						<p>I want to make it simple and really easy to use so for my interface I’ll use a touch screen with 2 options to use. The first option is for users who doesn’t know where or what floor should they select, they can type where they want to go. For example, the user wants to go to the cafeteria, then the elevator will go to the place selected by the user. By the way, if the user knows what floor he or she wants to go to, they have the option to just type the floor and that’s it.</p>
						<p>In my last option this is really helpful for people who carry a lot of stuff that they need for their job. </p>
						<p>They have the option to just click the button and the elevator system will ask them what floor they want to go to. Basically, this option is voice activated and I think it is really helpful because a lot of people usually carry a lot of stuff on their way to the office.  </p>
