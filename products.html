I’d able to express myself by an activity she gave us, and even I discover something about myself because of that first activity. We also had a presentation in front of the class but I know to myself that I’m not really good at speaking in front of other people, because I’m afraid that they might judge me or my work. But it also made me realized that I have to improve myself in order to grow and get better. I also need to improve my thinking skills because this is a design class and we have to have great ideas or design not only for mobile apps or webpage but also in other things. I learned that we you design something you should consider a lot of things because design is useless if it’s not helping the users or it’s too much for them. I like this class because I can freely express myself and become better because I can learn if I make a mistake.</p>

I’ve also notice that I have been very nervous when it comes to doing a lot of task or assignment because it’s not only in Userdes that we do a lot of things but also in other subjects. I want to thank Ms. Arroyo because she have been very considerate about our task and she was there when we have to think of the type of App our group wants to work on.</p>

						<p class="mb-0">For my first web application, at first, I find it hard to do because I was in my 2nd year of high school when we talked about html or webpage making. And when we were asking to do our own webpage I was a bit nervous because I already forgot about how to make a webpage. But then I’m very thankful about YouTube because it taught me how to do basic html programming and because of it I learned html. With basic information I have, I tried to search for the more advance things about html. And it worked. Because of this activity I have learned that I still have a lot of things to learn and I also need read more about programming and other languages that is need in user design. Overall, I enjoy doing html programming because I have the ability to design my own activity and It makes me really happy the my output looks presentable.</p>

							<p class="mb-0">UI Puzzle Userinyerface is an exciting web page that would not only challenge your brain and logical thinking but also your patience. Base from my first try, I really thought that it was a simple web page that would let you interact with it. But I was wrong, it took me 8-10 minutes to finish my first try and it was really frustrating. At that particular moment I realize something, that it is not only in that web page that we lose our temper or we feel frustrated, it happens in our everyday lives. Sometimes we think that our life sucks because of that particular moment but no, we have to find solutions or keep fighting to achieve what we want. Just like in Userinyerface, you have to try and try and get through your problems in order for you to be successful and finish the puzzle. As I finish the puzzle, my second try was I bit easy because I already know what to do, just like in like as we grow and got used to the problems that is happening in our life. We become better and we already know how to react with those problems. And that was Userinyerface taught me. </p>

							<p class="mb-0">	On the first day of Socit fest, my friends and I join the ML tournament. We were really excited about it because we've been practicing since last week and we wanted to show are skills and of course have fun. I'm an officer of JPCS so I knew that Gaming genesis really did a great job in organizing the event, hands down that event was amazing. In the second day I attended 4 seminars that was organized by JPCS, JISSA AND MICROSOFT. All the seminars are amazing and helped me understand more about game design, the importance of internet of things and of course the complicated world of system security. Because of those seminars my passion for IT has grown and I wanted to really learn more. Even though I'm having a hard time on doing my webpage Ms. Jen reminded me that being in the IT industry is really challenging and I want to take this opportunity to learn more, and those seminars provided me Inspiration to continue and work on my webpage. On the third day of Socit fest I didn't attend the Socit night because I don't like loud music and being surrounded by a lot of people, that's why I left early. Overall, Socit fest is really fun and helped me out on my IT problems.</p>

								<p class="mb-0">USERDES class has been great so far, it helped me improve a lot of my quality as a student and also as a person. The first quality that I have notice is that my thinking skills is improved and I can now think of good ideas for certain projects, for example the Ufundme application that we did. With just a simple news paper it gave me an idea that some children need my help and with that we came up with the project. Next quality is that I have improved my ability to cope with other people with the groupings that miss had given us, I learned to cooperate and brainstorm with my groupmates. I still have a lot of things that I want to improve in myself, because I know that it can help me in my future jobs. My expectations for finals is that miss with give us more activities that will show our creative abilities and would enhances or leadership abilities.</p>
